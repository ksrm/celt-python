celt-python
===========

Minimal Python bindings for the CELT audio codec. Ported from [celt-ruby](https://github.com/perrym5/celt-ruby) with added decoder functionality.

Usage
-----

There's not much to it. See the test script for details (requires pyaudio). Requires CELT v0.7.0. 
The [CELT API reference](http://www.celt-codec.org/docs/API.pdf) may also be of use.
